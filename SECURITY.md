## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Meeting Bot seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to [security@yourdomain.com](mailto:security@yourdomain.com).

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

- **Type of issue** (buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability**
- **The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)**
- **Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue**
- **Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue**
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)**
- **Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it**

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer to receive vulnerability reports in English, but we can also handle reports in other languages if necessary.

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will assign it to a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process, involving the following steps:

1. Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
2. Audit code to find any similar problems.
3. Prepare fixes for all supported versions. These fixes will be released as fast as possible to the main branch.

## Comments on this Policy

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved, please submit a pull request.
