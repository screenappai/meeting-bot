## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

### Meeting Join Requirements

Meeting Bot supports joining meetings where users can join with a direct link without requiring authentication. The following scenarios are **not supported**:

- **Sign-in Required**: Meetings that require users to sign in to the platform (Google, Microsoft, Zoom) before joining
- **Enterprise Authentication**: Meetings that require enterprise SSO or domain-specific authentication
- **Password Protected**: Meetings that require a password in addition to the meeting link
- **Waiting Room with Authentication**: Meetings where the waiting room requires user identification or authentication

**Supported Scenarios:**
- ‚úÖ Public meeting links that allow direct join
- ‚úÖ Meetings with waiting rooms that don't require authentication
- ‚úÖ Meetings where the bot can join as a guest/anonymous participant
